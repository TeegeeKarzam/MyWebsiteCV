            <div class="caption">
                <p>Filippo Loreti is a watchmaker from Italy whose mission is to make luxury accessible in people’s everyday life, which may already seem a paradox. It states to provide extreme quality watches at a reasonable price. Indeed, the main feature of the brand seems to be its prices, defined as “down-to-earth”. It seems that the mission of the brand is to sell watches that can be compared to high end watches made by Rolex, IWC, or Longines, at lower prices because it does not think it is right to charge a huge mark-up...</p><a href="/Users/thibaultgrisel/Desktop/Project UDEMY HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT/VERSION FINALE/Blogs/Homepage/Loreti/loreti.html">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY</a>

                <p>Luxury brands are sometimes susceptible of management mistakes, some decisions can be profitable in the short-term but catastrophic in the long run.
                    Burberry is a legendary British brand originally founded by Thomas Burberry in London in 1856 and specialized in outdoors clothing, which in 1879 created the gabardine: the world’s first waterproof fabric. It probably owes part of its reputation to the fact that was the apparel provider for British soldiers during I and II World Wars, indeed its iconic trench coat was designed to meet soldiers’ needs...</p><a href="/Users/thibaultgrisel/Desktop/Project UDEMY HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT/VERSION FINALE/Blogs/Homepage/chavs/chavs.html">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY</a>

                <p>Luxury brands usually rely on flagship stores in major cities’ high streets, because such boutiques allow them to be visible to the customers they target and contribute to the establishment of a prestigious brand image. However, renting fees of stores in such locations are extremely high and this means that it is difficult that these shops are profitable for the company, but at the same time they are very important to ...</p><a href="/Users/thibaultgrisel/Desktop/Project UDEMY HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT/VERSION FINALE/Blogs/Homepage/popup/popup.html">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY</a>

                    Grown up in Bordeaux, he went to Paris to study Art and Fashion Techniques at ESMOD and graduated in 2003.

From the very moment that you walk into the site, you can feel the prestige and heritage of the brand. Even the architecture of the buildings is a mix of tradition and innovation, where more historic buildings surround the brand new factory, opened in late 2017. The factory itself is a piece of art, it looks so clean, precise, beautiful, just like an OMEGA watch...</p><a href="/Users/thibaultgrisel/Desktop/Project UDEMY HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT/VERSION FINALE/Blogs/Homepage/omega/omega.html">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY</a>

            <p>Even if the majority of French luxury houses communicate and base their brands’ images on the French know-how and elegance, many of their products are not made in France. Indeed, except for some bags and jewellery, many other products are often made in other countries such as Scotland, Spain, Turkey,  Hong Kong, China and India. According to the European Union, fashion firms are allowed to use “made in France” tags even if... </p><a href="/Users/thibaultgrisel/Desktop/Project UDEMY HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT/VERSION FINALE/Blogs/Homepage/mdein/madein.html">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY</a>
