It seems that the mission of the brand is to sell watches that can be compared to high end watches made by Rolex, IWC, or Longines, at lower prices because it does not think it is right to charge a huge mark-up...</p><a href="/Users/thibaultgrisel/Desktop/Project UDEMY HTLM CSS JAVASCRIPT/VERSION FINALE/Blogs/Homepage/blog.html">CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY</a>
