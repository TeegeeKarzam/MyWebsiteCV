    <p>Millennials and Generation Z represent a critical portion of luxury customers. Projections see that their spending will increase of 4% this year. This generation’s shift brings new values, new ways of consuming and different expectations for the market. Brands have to take this into account in their offer. Social media plays a crucial role in millennial’s life, indeed they are sharing more and more contents on their pages to increase their social status and look like famous influencers who are setting trends and act as a reference for them.
        In the past streetwear was defined as fashionable casual clothes, recently it became more popular because people are wearing more and more this kind of clothes. Since a few years, the streetwear industry has been through a radical change. Many brands found ways to differ from competitors by becoming more exclusive. Luxury brands at first were skeptical about this industry, worried by the risk of diluting their brands and losing customers that did not want their favourite brands to be associated with casual clothes. Nevertheless, some brave brands anticipated changes and launched collections of high-end versions of streetwear clothes destined to enthusiast customers that wanted to feel comfortable while still have an outstanding style. Luxury brands usually used high prices to create exclusivity, but in the streetwear industry exclusivity does not only come from high prices. It comes from the difficulty and ability to know what to buy to look cool and, more importantly, where to buy. Luxury brands willing to enter the streetwear industry need to be aware of this and take decisions regarding the supply to make it really limited and selective. Traditional luxury brands, such as Gucci or Louis Vuitton, entered the streetwear industry because they saw it as an opportunity to renew themselves and becoming trendier towards new generations.
        Because of the very limited offer of designer clothes, consumers have to be the first to enter shops (both online and physical stores) to be able to buy them. The disruption here is that luxury company will have to compete versus non-traditional luxury companies, which are also releasing more prestigious products in the streetwear.
        Luxury companies have to be aware that the typical streetwear consumer is different from their regular customer. He is often young, and does not have a high income, so he selects pieces that make him unique and authentic. Moreover, he uses a lot of social media and posts about his style. He is influenced by his peers and influencers, but at the same time he has an influence over his followers. Because of that, consumers are the ones that decide what is trending and popular and what is not, and brands have to understand these trends to look appealing to potential customers (the approach is down-top, while in traditional industries it is top-down, with companies creating and dictating trends and fashions).
        Brands often use the drop model to sell their new collections (in stores or online), limiting the number of people that actually manage to buy their products to keep them as exclusive as possible. The consequence is that some people buy products only to resell them at much higher prices later on. This annoys a lot of consumers that end up looking for fakes and counterfeit replicas of their favourite brands. 
        The phenomenon of counterfeit could be a huge problem for high-end brands, the risk of diluting the brand can scare off consumers and counterfeiting can steal enormous amount of money to luxury brands.</div>
