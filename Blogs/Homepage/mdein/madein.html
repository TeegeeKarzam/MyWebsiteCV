    <p>Even if the majority of French luxury houses communicate and base their brands’ images on the French know-how and elegance, many of their products are not made in France. Indeed, except for some bags and jewellery, many other products are often made in other countries such as Scotland, Spain, Turkey,  Hong Kong, China and India. According to the European Union, fashion firms are allowed to use “made in France” tags even if items have been mainly produced in another countries, as long as a luxury French firm has finished or packaged products in France. In other words European fashion firms only need to partially manufacture a product in a certain country to earn the “made in France” label. This undermines the transparency about the origin of a product, which is often-times different in customers’ mind.
        Given that luxury customers are particularly sensitive to the place where the product is designed and produced, well-known French fashion brands are leveraging on their heritage and know-how, on the fact that France is one of the countries where fashion was born, the native country of many famous brands and a symbol of elegance and style, in order to convince customers that their products are authentic. Many luxury brands might sacrify partially their local roots in order to increase their profits, because international luxury groups such as LVMH and Kering, ask them to achieve high financial performances. Therefore these firms decide to delocalize their production for various reasons: to satisfy the demand, to reach economies of scale but also to meet the demand of know-how that has become impossible to find in France. In "Luxury & Co", a book on the behind the scenes of fashion, Dana Thomas goes further: the book reveals how a Chinese factory in Dongguan, north of Shenzhen, produces luxury bags. Here we can find hundreds of young women in light blue blouses working in a five floors’ building, repeating the same tasks for more than twelve hours a day, before joining the dormitory in front of the building. One group sticks the pockets, another gives the hammer on the flaps, the third assembles the elements. There are factories in China that are producing products for both French fashion houses and at the same time counterfeit products. This example clearly illustrates how this activity has gone out of the control of French luxury houses.
        This “made-in” issue could become a real challenge for brands because it negatively affects brand authenticity. Indeed, this can jeopardize the brand by making it incoherent with its integrity, credibility and continuity. As explained, houses are using their legacy and tradition as a main argument for the sales and if customers notice that the products are not made as they expect, that could be really deceptive for them and damage significantly the brand image. It therefore blurs the dream dimension of luxury brands and customers might see the high price of an item not justified if produced in a country where labour costs are way lower than France.
        Moreover the practice to lie about where most of the production of an item takes place in favour of brand reputation and heritage has a negative impact on brand transparency towards customers. Millennials are more and more concerned about ethical issues such as bad work conditions, black labour and child labour in country like China or India and also about environmental issues. The fact that some brands are trying to hide their manufacturing process could be even more outrageous for future generation customers. 
        To solve this dilemma French houses have several options. The first one, the more drastic, would be to relocate all factories in France, but this obviously means that brands would have to decrease their margins to keep the price stable and it would bring a significant decrease of profit. An alternative could be to remove the “made-in” label or make it less visible, even if it is not the more moral solution it would at least preserve the mystery dimension of the brands. Another solution could be to shift the attention of the customers more onto the design instead of the location of production. For instance firms could put the label “designed in France” avoiding the made in issue. To increase authenticity and transparency it could be a solution to put both labels “designed in France” and “made in China”, but this would have repercussion on the price which would have to be cheaper considering the perceived low quality location. On the other hand this might increase the firm perception in term of trust in the eye of the customers.</p>
