    <p>Olivier Rousteing was born in 1985 in Bordeaux, and he was then adopted by a French couple at the age of 1. He does not know who his biological parents are, but only knows that both were African migrants.
        Grown up in Bordeaux, he went to Paris to study Art and Fashion Techniques at ESMOD and graduated in 2003. After that, he was hired at Roberto Cavalli and became the creative director of the brand’s ready-to-wear women collection.
        In 2009 he moved to Balmain and he had the same role he had at Roberto Cavalli, but in 2011 Balmain’s creative director, Christophe Decarnin, had to leave the company due to a burnout and Rousteing stepped into his role at the age of 25.
        Olivier Rousteing is the youngest creative director in the French fashion industry after Yves Saint Laurent, and his personal background has an influence over his style and the way he designs collections for Balmain. With his first collections, he wanted to pay homage to the previous creative director Decarnin (with whom he had a very good relationship) and decided to have a chaotic elegant style. Afterwards his designs became a mix of Balmain’s traditional style and more audacious touches, such as bright colors and tapestry inserts. He brought a fresh touch to the brand’s style, inspiring himself from the finest French couture and getting influenced by some Asian characteristics, appealing to Asian customers.
        What really makes Rousteing unique and admired in the whole fashion industry is his manifestation of youth, his belonging to the Millennials generation and his audacity to come up with a new and different style. He is sensitive to millennials’ main concerns such as women empowerment or diversity, and uses fashion to deal with such issues (i.e. Balmain’s models are very diverse in terms of origins, look and skin-color). 
        Thanks to his young age, Rousteing understood the needs and habits of young generations and so he became a pioneer for his use of social media, which was his biggest tools for creating his own brand image (he has around 5,6 millions followers on Instagram). Indeed, he is very active to communicate and create a real connection with his community and he is well known for sharing a big part of his life, work and parties with selfies. He also developed his communication by exposing his friendship with lots of famous icons like Cara Delevingne, Beyoncé, Kanye West. He employs many celebrities brand ambassadors, such as Kendall Jenner, Adriana Lima and Joan Smalls. He is so close to his muses that he even calls them the “Balmain Army”.
        Up to now, Rousteing has not started yet his own label, because he is very focused on Balmain and has other priorities that go beyond the fashion industry (he is focused on discovering as much as possible about his biological parents), but it is possible that in the future he will create his own brand thanks to the huge success he is getting as creative director of Balmain.
        Like many other successful creative directors, Olivier Rousteing has been the subject of a documentary-film produced in 2019 and showed just on October the 16th on Canal Plus. The movie, called “Wonder Boy”, is not about the fabulous life of the designer or about the birth of his newest collection. It narrates the story of a young boy who does not who his real parents are and is desperate to know the truth and the secrets about his birth. The documentary has also the goal of showing that it is possible for everybody, no matter his origins or background, to be successful and to achieve his dreams. It is an inspirational movie, not a celebration of the creative director, Rousteing defines it as “a movie about a fighter who faced the world”.
        In many interviews, Rousteing stated that the more his Instagram success grew, the more he felt the need to fake its image. He needs to pose all the time and provide an image of himself that is different from reality, because this makes him feel more protected.
        However, the main challenge Olivier Rousteing has been facing over time is related to his origins. He has been very committed to know about what happened after his birth and why he was left by his parents, and he had to face many difficulties in this process. 
        The fashion industry itself can be very hard, it is very stressful due to short timelines and designers have to constantly come up with new collections. To push the boundaries of their creativity, many of them do drugs or alcohol and end up having to leave their roles due to burnouts. Missing a key person as his mother and being one of the youngest creative director of all times, made Rousteing very vulnerable and his reaction was not to trust anyone, becoming even more alone.</p>
