        Luxury brands usually rely on flagship stores in major cities’ high streets, because such boutiques allow them to be visible to the customers they target and contribute to the establishment of a prestigious brand image. However, renting fees of stores in such locations are extremely high and this means that it is difficult that these shops are profitable for the company, but at the same time they are very important to mark the presence of the brand in the most exclusive locations. Moreover, flagship stores have to provide a consistent brand image of prestige and elegance over time, meaning that there is little room for fancy decorations. Recently, many luxury brands started to use temporary pop-up stores to showcase their latest collections or to host new initiatives, such as Harrods’ Fashion Re-Told (where customers could buy second hand goods from Stella McCartney and Chloé). This new distribution concept allows luxury brands to extend and strengthen their physical presence into new markets and at the same it presents a low-cost, flexible and perfect way to communicate about the brand’s values and history. It is also a way to speed-up time to market. Nowadays markets are extremely fast-paced and pop-up stores, thanks to their flexible and accessible nature, allow brands to display their latest collections in a temporary manner in high-traffic strategic points.

A pop-up store is the perfect tool for a luxury brand to maintain its exclusivity. Indeed, pop-up stores have a short life, meaning that they manage to generate very high buzz and awareness, but the number of customers that actually shop there is very limited. Moreover, such stores act primary as showrooms, where people can see new collections, latest products or limited editions, but sales are limited. In addition to that, pop-up stores can offer a high degree of personalization, which is something that new generations of customers value more and more.
Pop-up stores generate excitement around new collections and create a sense of scarcity due to their limited lifespan, which is a pillar in the luxury industry. Additionally, pop-up stores are ultimately embodying the mission of advertising in luxury brands: being known and visible to a large crowd to strengthen their awareness, while still maintaining an inaccessible image.

Pop-up stores are very useful for brands to test the presence into a new market or location. Usually pop-up stores are temporary, so brands can assess if a location has the potential to attract the current customer base or to appeal to whole new customers.
Moreover, in pop-up stores it is possible to engage more with the customer, since often in such locations there are special activities, such as workshops, that contribute to make the experience more unique. It is also common that pop-up stores offer a higher degree of customization for example by allowing consumers to add a monogram to leather goods or by choosing the packaging they prefer, making them appreciate even more the whole experience and ending up having a better attitude towards the brand. Luxury consumers like a lot when they feel that their favourite brand has a personal approach towards them, and pop-up stores represent a good opportunity to satisfy this kind of desire. Pop-up stores create a more connected experience that customers value a lot.
Pop-up stores also allow brands to push their boundaries of creativity, making the store itself a piece of art. This contributes to create the desire of entering for consumers and it also creates a distinctive image in customers’ minds.
Pop-up stores, being so different from flagship boutiques, are definitely something special, and the way they interact with customers make them feel very special. Moreover, some pop-up stores do not even require salespeople to be present, or rely just on very few employees, since the ultimate goal is not to sell but to be seen. In addition to that, pop-up stores are great tools to conduct behavioral experiments on customers. By the volatile nature of pop-up stores and by the high traffic surrounding it, myriads of experiments could be conducted in order to assess preferences, or to see in real time which shops are generating more traffic, for which reasons and so on. The dream would be to have totally digitized pop-up stores and to change the decorations in real time based on location, customers, time of the day, while staying true to the brand’s value and image.

Pop-up stores have to last very little time, otherwise they will lose their aura of exclusivity and this could consequently damage the brand by making it look less exclusive. Moreover it is important that a brand does not rely too often on temporary stores in the same city, since this will make consumers believe that if they miss an opportunity, sooner or later they will have a second chance and therefore they do  not get hyped when they learn that their favourite brand is opening a pop-up store in their city. Moreover, brands need to know who they target with a specific pop-up store, and consequently they need to choose the best location and style for the shop. However, a risk could be that, by pushing creativity too much, loyal customers do not identify themselves in the brand and therefore switch to more classy brands that maintain a more elegant style.

Luxury brands have the chance of appealing to new generations of consumers by using pop-up stores to address their needs and desires. These shops target new customers because they manage to generate a lot of noise (also on social media) that increases brand awareness. At the same time, by using such a concept for very limited editions or special launches, brands can limit even more their accessibility through to the short lifespan of pop-up stores. Moreover, brands can exploit pop-ups to allow personal, customized interactions with their fans and this will create deeper relationships with the customer base. In the future, pop-up stores will be a key tool for brands to better serve future generations that seek different experiences compared to previous ones. In order to support this argument, pop-up stores could be solely used as a marketing tool, meaning that they would displays the new collections, attract visibility, share the brand’s essence, without allowing sales to take place. This would reinforce the inaccessible image and therefore pop-up stores would be just considered as “3D advertisement”.
