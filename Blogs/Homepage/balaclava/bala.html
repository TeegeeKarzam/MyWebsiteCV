        The phenomenon of globalization has dramatically impacted the way firms approach their different geographical markets and their related cultures which oftentimes need to be taken into account in a more specific manner instead of a general and standardized global strategy. Given their educational purpose and their aspirational values, luxury firms have even more responsibility towards all their stakeholders. 
        Gucci decided to introduce a new product, the balaclava, as a part of the 2018 fall/winter collection. The intention was probably to launch an innovative product, giving a sense of mystery to the people wearing it, that reflected the bold spirit of the brand. The hope was that it could become a highlight, particularly among millennials. Unfortunately, this product soon turned out to be hated by Americans with the risk to spillover this hate to the brand.
        At the beginning of 2018, as the Black History Month was approaching, a lot of buzz was raised on twitter over the balaclava knit top by Gucci because it was accused to recall the
        blackface due to its colors and design. The blackface imaginary may not be well known in Europe but it is certainly a natural association in the US where, given the historical events, racism and slavery are bad memories that most of Americans want to forget. 
        This black jumper has a turtleneck that goes all over the nose as a balaclava and has a hole for the mouth surrounded by a red “lipstick”. Due to its total black look with red lips, it was immediately linked to the blackface culture that basically is a racist way to refer to black people adopted by white people during the times of the slavery. This stylistic choice was a huge mistake which costed Gucci a lot in terms of both image and brand reputation, but also in terms of money since the item has been withdrawn by the brand right after the claims started to spread all over the web. 
        This terrible error can be seen as a matter of diversity and integrity, the same core values that Gucci and other fashion luxury brands like Prada and Moncler have always intensively
        tried to pursue and promote all around the world. It is hard to point the finger to someone specifically within Gucci, nonetheless a company with such reputation should be sure whether each product’s concept fits into an important market as US or at least does not raise too many questions over its appropriateness when it comes to worldwide distribution. The alignment with local values and beliefs should be as smooth as possible and there must be respect towards foreign cultures. Being Gucci an Italian firm with italian (or european) designers it is understandable that they may not have been thinking over such a resemblance with the blackface culture. This oversight is rather unacceptable for the manager responsible for US distribution which should have foreseen such a strong linkage thanks to their knowledge of the market, its history and then its customers.
        After the first complaints Gucci promptly withdrawn the product away from the website and from every physical store, also publishing on social media publicly apologizing for the
        offence caused by the jumper reassuring that diversity is one of their main values and that this mistake will be a lesson for the brand. Matteo Bizzarri, CEO of the label, sent an internal email to his staff acknowledging the mistakes and saying that this is a matter of cultural ignorance, but ignorance is not an excuse. Eventually he said that Gucci had to take its responsibilities and deal with this issue because everybody was displaying Gucci with values that did not represent the integrity of the brand. For this reason, he immediately took care of this problem announcing a global cultural-awareness program and a scholarship program all over the world to increase the understanding of cultural differences and ensure that lacking knowledge about diversities will never happen again. This case is a good proof that when a brand wants to launch a new product or even makes a basic marketing decision, it should be very careful about the cultural dimension that this decision can have, especially in big markets such as United States in this case. Nevertheless, by admitting its fault, Gucci has leveraged on its mistakes in order to demonstrate its true commitment towards social values and quickly got out of this crisis, stronger than before. 
        The fact that nowadays Gucci ranks among the most loved luxury fashion brands in US proves it.  </p>
