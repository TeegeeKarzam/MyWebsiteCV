    <p>A recent study made by Bain & Co predicts that by 2025, new generations (millennials and generation Z) will represent almost 50% of the global luxury market. Given that, it is obviously critical for luxury brands to better understand their needs and expectations.
        The ultimate objective of Millennial customers when consuming luxury goods is to show off their designer clothes, especially through social media in order to establish a certain status and therefore be socially accepted. Their main focus and key buying factor is not related to the quality of the product and its materials, but they are much more interested in clothes that show big logos that make them visible. Millennials make luxury purchases with the end goal of being perceived as unique and authentic as possible, but also because they want to fit into a mold that they want to become part of.
        Previous generation were driven mostly by personal tastes and a classical idea of elegance and style when consuming luxury goods. Previous generation favored internal attributes of a product, millennials favored external, social attributes. On the contrary, millennials are heavily influenced by influencers which set the rules of the game and are taken as references by the majority of Millennials. Moreover, they want to show off their luxurious lifestyle on social media to establish their status and to look cool among their friends.
        Millennials also have a growing interest in brand collaborations and they already take into account the possibility to resell the luxury item on the second-hand market during their decision-making process.
        In contrast with previous generations who felt the need to be associated with an elitist group with shared value, Millennials take purchases decisions to stand out as individuals by distancing themselves from the classical standards and relying more on latest trends set by most influencing characters. Luxury brands are adapting their products to this generation’s tastes through the combination of successful old features and new styles dictated by new young cultures. Millennials’ tastes are deeply influenced by US subcultures that usually anticipate new trends. Moreover, kids from this generation despite not having a high income are often really into luxury trends. They are willing to invest a lot of money in luxury items to cure their image and this can be explained by the fact that constant social networks exposure makes them feel under the view of their peers.
        Since millennials seek for comfy and eccentrics pieces of clothing, luxurious brands tend to put out those items, so they are shifting from the classical lines. Moreover, luxury brands in order to attract these new customers need to use new channels like social media and online shopping, the latter is quite a big change for luxury brands that usually rely a lot on their physical shop and related in-shop experience.
        This generation represents an important target for luxury brands in terms of sales, however well-established companies need to be careful to keep a balance between different generations’ tastes when designing new products to avoid brand dilution.
        There is no more campaign cycle and companies need to be present 24/7 on social media and be able to not just highlight a product, but the whole story that is behind it and the brand. Millennials really care about emotional value and the only way to capture their attention on the web is by giving them a story and values to believe in. 
        Moreover, Millennial luxury consumers are interested in second-hand shopping and in vintage clothes, this tendency is completely new and disrupt traditional luxury brand. 
        Millennials especially like streetwear modern brands, such as Off-White and Vetements, but they appreciate a lot also more classical luxury brands that adopted a modern twist like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga or Hublot. In order to apply this modern twist company such Louis Vuitton hired the creative director of Off-White which happen to have a stronger streetwear background that is quite unconventional considering LV classic style. Moreover, the phenomenon of collaborations between streetwear brands and classical luxury brand is more and more popular. Collaboration are the best explanation to the millennial paradox: wanting to be unique while being part of a “cool” group. In this regard collaborations allow millennials to benefit from the brand image and thus be part of the group of people wearing that brand, while the collaboration’s exclusive piece allow them to express their personality and be unique through customization and/or limited editions.
        The typical millennial luxury consumer does a heavy use of social media and try to look like its idols that oftentimes are no longer famous actors but rather influencers and hip-hop artists. Plus, he/she is really into the consumption of experience such as premium restaurant or luxury travel and is willing to spend a lot of money for the most unique experiences.
        Since they are heavy influenced by social media, they will always look for models to imitate on those platforms and unlikely will develop their own sense of luxury. Their preferences will always depend on what the latest social trends will be, but when growing up, it is likely that Millennials will need to look more formal accordingly to their professional environment still looking stand out.
