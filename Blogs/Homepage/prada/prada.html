Sustainability is now a core element in Prada’s global strategy, the firm takes it seriously and it is reshaping its core identity. Prada has both the ambition and the capabilities to change not only because it may feel obligated, but also because it wants to have a purpose in what it does, it aspires to be meaningful. Prada’s commitment goes from recycling products, to diversity at work and by assuring a cooperation between the stakeholders. The company shows great motivation since it has been guided by the 17 United Nations sustainable development goals, in order to be in adequation with what is considered one of the most serious organization in the world.
Sustainable luxury could be appealing for high-end customers if certain luxury codes are respected. It is not all about the fabric but rather a matter of perception, if a brand manages to write in the mind of the public that sustainability is a great thing and that people engaging in sustainability or using sustainable products can have their conscious clean. For this the company will maybe need to enhance the level of service to justify the high price when it will stop using un-sustainable fabrics that are currently a part of the  reason for those high-priced items and at the end the ultimate goal would be to have clothing as a service. Meaning that everybody would rent its clothes and they will be re-used by other people, thus increasing the “efficiency” of the clothes. Luxury fashion firms should all put more emphasis on the standards of sustainability being cutting-edge in respecting the environment and guide the whole fashion sector to follow them. 
Traditionally the fashion industry is considered as one of the most polluting ones, but recently Prada, the Italian family-owned fashion firm which also controls Miu Miu, Church’s and Carshoe, has signed a five years loan of 50 million euro with Crédit Agricole. It represents a further and more complete initiative to support the environment after the launch of collection of bags entirely made of Re-nylon, a sustainable nylon made of recycled ocean plastic, following the trend of eco nylon already used by Stella McCartney, Adidas and Triumph, and also after the announce to stop using animal fur in its garments from February 2020.
This is a particular type of loan as it contains repayment terms strictly related to sustainability efforts in both its operations and products. Indeed, the interest rates to be payed to Crédit Agricole can be reduced if the Italian fashion company will achieve certain standards of sustainability. The three main parameters the French bank will take into account are LEED certification, 
The first parameter is the number of direct point of sales evaluated as gold or platinum physical shops by the green-building rating system Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). It will evaluate the design and construction of shops, their emissions, their recycling activities, their waste and many more dimensions.
The second one is the number of employees training hours about the elimination of the use of the material virgin nylon by 2021 and the third one is related to the increase of use of Re-nylon in the manufacturing of Prada products.
In other words, Prada is trying to force/commit itself to improve its sustainability practises by anchoring its new green initiatives to its financial results, which also depend on this loan. This is a big symbolic step, mixing two dimensions that in the past were so often separated and disconnected one from the other.
The news has had a huge media coverage because it represents the first case of “green loan” in fashion industry and, although it does not represent an high law for Prada Group, it is an important and clear signal to current and potential customers about their commitment towards sustainability. 
Alessandra Cozzani, CFO at Prada, explained to Vogue: “This transaction demonstrates that sustainability is a key element for the development of the Prada Group, increasingly integrated into our strategy”
Luxury brands have the power and the responsibility to educate people to sustainability. They should be pioneers in the use of new and alternative materials and show to their clients their efforts to minimize their impact on the environment. These firms have creativity and innovation as instruments to change people minds without expressing any political orientation or preference, but simply expressing their values. 
Luxury brands have such an esoteric and mystic aspect related to themselves, making them really salient for consumers but also for the general public, they could be seen as opinions leaders and pioneers. 
Moreover some part of the luxury industry has suffered in the past regarding fairness and sustainability that they are trying to “repair” a reputation that might have been broken in this regards.
Luxury brands in my opinion have to play the same role of educators as politicians or as activists, the form of conveying the message may change but the substance has to be the same. As a whole, the human species has to ally concerning those major environmental and societal problems, and if the message is conveyed by people so different such as politicians, activist or luxury brands, the general public will understand that it is really serious and important. The goal here is the cooperation with many diverse entities in order to support the fact that the brand understands the situation and that the public reacts about it.
The luxury brands have also the luck that their customers are usually very wealthy people employed in very high positions and have the power to influence things at an higher level than mass market brand customer. Of course this is a generalization, but it is our assumption that luxury brand customers could be more powerful in term of influence than a “regular brand shopper”. If brands manage to educate those customer, for example they may give genuine inspiration to a CEO of a big company, or to a politicians, without doing it for the financial or reputational aspect (which has doomed this world in my opinion), when this will happen I would say that luxury brands are well doing their job of educators.
