        Filippo Loreti is a watchmaker from Italy whose mission is to make luxury accessible in people’s everyday life, which may already seem a paradox. It states to provide extreme quality watches at a reasonable price. Indeed, the main feature of the brand seems to be its prices, defined as “down-to-earth”. It seems that the mission of the brand is to sell watches that can be compared to high end watches made by Rolex, IWC, or Longines, at lower prices because it does not think it is right to charge a huge <br><br>
By looking at Filippo Loreti’s men watches for example, it is possible to notice that models really look like many watches from other luxury watchmakers. Filippo Loreti’s Okeanos Steel Link is very similar to the Rolex Submariner Date Watch for example, while Filippo Loreti’s Venice Automatic resembles a Patek Philippe Grandes Complications. Some models, like the Ascari Indigo series, are clearly inspired from the Omega Seamaster collection. The bracelet, the dials and even the colours are indeed very similar. If we have a closer look at women watches, it is possible to see similarities between Filippo Loreti’s Rome and the IWC Portofino Automatic. 
These examples show that the brand does not try to emulate a single luxury watchmaker but focuses instead of producing watches that are similar to iconic models as the Rolex Submariner or the Patek Philippe Grandes Complications. This is a strategy that Filippo Loreti may use to target many different consumers with watches of radically different styles. <br>
Filippo Loreti seems to care about approaching the largest number of consumers by providing them with an accessible version of their favourite watch. However, this is not the best strategy to be perceived as a luxury brand. As we know, every luxury brand has a unique code that distinguishes it from other brands, the code may be related to a colour scheme, a shape or a logo. By inspiring itself (if not coping) other famous watch brands’ physique, it is impossible for Filippo Loreti to be perceived as unique and be desirable for consumers. Apart from developing a unique and authentic line of watches that stand out of competition, the brand may need to create a story about itself that goes further the concept of accessibility to luxury. Filippo Loreti needs to create an image of itself that makes consumers desire it, but at the same time the feeling of desire has to be sustained by a limited purchase availability. <br> All luxury brands have symbols that are tied to their DNA, such as the crown for Rolex or the omega Greek letter for Omega, Loreti does not have any symbol that makes it easy for people to recognize it at sight. Moreover, the prices of Filippo Loreti watches are too low to make the brand look as a luxury one. The consequence of that is that not only luxury consumers do not even consider the brand, but people may also doubt of the quality of the products and therefore question the fact that the brand really manufactures luxury watches. As anticipated, the main problem is that low price is stressed as the main attribute in a Filippo Loreti’s watch, which is totally opposite of what is common for in luxury marketing. In luxury brand what may matter is the brand, the country of origin, but it never is the price. By definition luxury goods are expected to be expensive, and their main value is symbolic and experiential, their functions are not really stressed and for sure a luxury brand does not have to show the convenience of its products. <br><br>
To be perceived as a luxury watchmaker for real, Filippo Loreti has to change completely its value proposition. It needs firstly to create a story around the brand, in order to create its personality and allow customers to identify with it. Moreover, this story has to create a desire for consumers to possess a Filippo Loreti watch, but at the same time the availability of watches has to be limited. The brand also needs to create whole new lines for men and women watches, in order to differentiate from luxury watchmakers and be finally unique, since luxury consumers want unique pieces that only few people have. The brand needs to increase its prices too if it wants to compete in the luxury market, because of that the whole mission of the company may need to change, since Filippo Loreti now promotes its affordable watches. <br>
Nevertheless, it has an interesting concept: making accessible “luxury”, by having exclusive collection, they are physically limiting the supply of certain model to justify the “luxury” side of it.

To build a “dream luxury brand” from scratch is extremely difficult. It may be possible if the product is really valuable, if it allows the consumer to really stand out and provides him with high symbolic and experiential value. However, dream brands rely a lot on their personality and this is often a consequence of the brand history and heritage. Because of that it may be extremely difficult to invent a brand that becomes a dream brand in a short time. Usually the most ambitious brands rely a lot on their background and their ability of reinvent themselves through generations without changing their signature systems. Creating a luxury brand from scratch requires craftsmanship, contacts, financial means, the creation of a story and brand personality, expertise in different fields and luck. It is not something that is created overnight.
However, it is also true that every luxury brand was originally created from scratch and therefore every brand can make it eventually, with dedication and clear strategy. Lamborghini for example was initially a tractors manufacturer, and now the company produces some of the most expensive and good-looking cars ever designed.
